Khovratovich, D., Biryukov, A., Nikolic, I.: Speeding up collision search for byteoriented hash functions. In: Fischlin, M. (ed.) Topics in Cryptology – CT-RSA 2009. LNCS, vol. 5473, pp. 164–181. Springer, Heidelberg, Germany, San Francisco, CA, USA (Apr 20–24, 2009)

Personally I regard it as a proof of my study during the five month in NTU.
